Developed a portfolio site containing an about me section, projects gallery, and contact form.


Portfolio Site: This refers to a website that showcases your work, skills, and achievements. In a professional context, it typically displays examples of projects, achievements, and other relevant information that highlights your abilities.

About Me Section: This is a dedicated part of the website where you provide information about yourself. It could include details about your background, education, skills, interests, and anything else that gives visitors a better understanding of who you are as a professional or individual.

Projects Gallery: This is a section of the website where you showcase your past projects. It's like an online portfolio where visitors can view and learn about the various projects you've worked on. This may include descriptions, images, videos, or other media to effectively communicate the scope and quality of your work.

Contact Form: This is a feature that allows visitors to the website to easily get in touch with you. Typically, it includes fields for the visitor to enter their name, email address, a message, and sometimes additional information. The contact form streamlines the communication process and encourages potential employers, clients, or collaborators to reach out.
